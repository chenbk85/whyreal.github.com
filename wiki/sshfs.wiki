Honebrew:

  `brew install sshfs`

In order for FUSE-based filesystems to work, the fuse4x kernel extension must be installed by the root user:

  {{{
  sudo /bin/cp -rfX /usr/local/Cellar/fuse4x-kext/0.9.2/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext /Library/Extensions
  sudo chmod +s /Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/Support/load_fuse4x
  }}}

If upgrading from a previous version of Fuse4x, the old kernel extension will need to be unloaded before performing the steps listed above. First, check that no FUSE-based filesystems are running:

  `mount -t fuse4x`

Unmount all FUSE filesystems and then unload the kernel extension:

  `sudo kextunload -b org.fuse4x.kext.fuse4x`
