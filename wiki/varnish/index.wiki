默认情况下varnish不会对cookie/set-cookie头做特殊处理，会正常缓存。但是一旦缓存了则会导致用户串号这样的恶性故障。这一点需要开发&运维提高警惕。

关于vanish对cookie的处理，官方文档有详细的说明，以下是文档中给出的最佳实践：

{{{
9.4 Best practices for cookies

Remove all cookies you know you do not need, then cache if none are left.

Use URL schemes that let you easily determine if a page needs a cookie or not. E.g:

• /common/ - strip all cookies.
• /user/ - Leave user-cookies.
• /voucher/ - Only leave the voucher-cookie. • etc.

Once you have a URL scheme that works, add the req.http.cookie to the cache hash in vcl_hash: hash_data(req.http.cookie);.

Never cache a Set-Cookie header. Either remove the header before caching or don't cache the object at all.

Avoid using return (deliver); more than once in vcl_fetch. Instead, finish up with something similar to:


if (beresp.ttl > 0s) {
    unset beresp.http.set-cookie;
} 

This will ensure that all cached pages are stripped of set-cookie.

A golden rule through all of this is: It's far better to either NOT cache or cache multiple copies of the same content for each user than it is to deliver the wrong content to the wrong person.

Your worst-case scenario should be a broken cache and overloaded web servers, not a compromised user-account and a lawsuit.
